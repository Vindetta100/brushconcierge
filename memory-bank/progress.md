# Progress

## What Works
- Professional URL structure (`/classic`, `/premium`, `/concierge`) is implemented.
- Router, configuration, and documentation are updated to reflect the new URLs.
- Old testing directories and files have been removed.
- Asset paths for the `/concierge` version have been fixed.

## What's Left to Build
- Verify the fix for the `/concierge` version on the live site after deployment.

## Current Status
- Fixes for the `/concierge` version have been committed and are deploying to Vercel.

## Known Issues
- The `/concierge` version was not loading correctly on production due to incorrect asset paths. This is now believed to be fixed and is pending verification.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decision to use professional, marketing-friendly URLs for A/B/C testing versions.
- The Memory Bank is now updated to reflect the actual project state and recent changes.
