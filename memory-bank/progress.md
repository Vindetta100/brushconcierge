## What Works
- Initial landing page deployment.
- Formspree integration for waitlist (form submission itself works, and data reception issue was resolved).
- Security scan completed with no critical findings.
- Text-based logo "Brush Concierge - TEST1" added and verified locally and on production.
- `README.md` updated with correct local development instructions and comprehensive Vercel deployment guidance for AI.
- Local changes successfully deployed to Vercel production, and custom domain updates are now reflecting correctly.
- New checkout system implemented with `checkout.html`, `checkout.css`, and `checkout.js`.
- Git operations for `feature/checkout-system` branch completed, including resolving embedded repository warning.
- CSS syntax error in `checkout.css` fixed.

## What's Left to Build
- **Stripe Integration**: Replace placeholder key in `checkout.js` with actual publishable key.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test the new checkout flow locally.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the new checkout system to production.

## Current Status
- Vercel deployment and custom domain update issues are resolved.
- `README.md` is fully updated for AI guidance.
- The new checkout system is implemented and ready for testing and final Stripe integration.

## Known Issues
- None currently, pending testing of the new checkout system.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Switched from custom form handling to Formspree for waitlist.
- Opted for text-based logo for quick implementation and theme consistency.
- Updated local development instructions in `README.md` for clarity and AI guidance.
- Confirmed direct local `vercel --prod` deployment workflow and addressed caching/DNS propagation.
- Implemented a new checkout system, transitioning from a waitlist model to direct purchase.
- Adopted Git branching for feature development to maintain a clean `main` branch.
