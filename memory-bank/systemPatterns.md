# System Patterns

## System Architecture
- The "Brush Bliss" application follows a client-side rendering approach.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for the frontend.
- API endpoints are handled in the `api/` directory.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Git is used for version control and collaboration.
- A structured Memory Bank is implemented for project documentation.

## Design Patterns in Use
- Modular JavaScript for routing and application logic.
- CSS for styling.

## Component Relationships
- `index.html` serves as the main entry point.
- `router.js` handles client-side routing.
- `app.js` contains core application logic.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- Git branching for feature development.
- Documentation updates for project continuity.
