## [Phase 1] - 2025-01-05 - Critical Blocking Issues

### Fixed

#### Enforce Terms Acceptance Requirement
- **Commit:** [66a8816](https://github.com/Vindetta100/brushconcierge/commit/66a8816) - `fix(checkout): enforce required terms acceptance validation`
- **Issue:** Terms checkboxes were optional, allowing users to complete orders without accepting T&C
- **Files Changed:**
  - `concierge/checkout.html` - Added `disabled` attribute to Complete Order button
  - `concierge/checkout.js` - Added `validateTermsAcceptance()` method and event listeners
- **Impact:** Prevents compliance issues by requiring both terms acceptance before order completion
- **Testing:** Verify button is disabled until both "Terms of Service" and subscription terms are checked

#### Clarify Stripe Test/Live Environment Handling  
- **Commit:** [9096034](https://github.com/Vindetta100/brushconcierge/commit/9096034) - `fix(api): clarify Stripe test/live environment handling`
- **Issue:** Mixed live/test environment caused confusion about test card behavior
- **Files Changed:**
  - `api/create-checkout-session.js` - Added comprehensive documentation comments
- **Impact:** Clear understanding that test card 4242 4242 4242 4242 works in live mode without charges
- **Testing:** Use test card for QA, stop at "Complete Order" to avoid any potential charges

### Implementation Details

#### Terms Validation Logic
```javascript
validateTermsAcceptance() {
    const termsChecked = document.getElementById('agreeTerms')?.checked;
    const subscriptionChecked = document.getElementById('agreeSubscription')?.checked;
    const completeOrderBtn = document.getElementById('completeOrder');
    
    if (completeOrderBtn) {
        const bothTermsAccepted = termsChecked && subscriptionChecked;
        completeOrderBtn.disabled = !bothTermsAccepted;
        
        // Visual feedback
        if (bothTermsAccepted) {
            completeOrderBtn.classList.add('enabled');
            completeOrderBtn.classList.remove('disabled');
        } else {
            completeOrderBtn.classList.add('disabled');
            completeOrderBtn.classList.remove('enabled');
        }
    }
}
```

#### Stripe Environment Documentation
- Live keys accept test cards for flow testing without charges
- Real cards would be charged if used
- Recommendation: Use staging environment with test keys for full testing

### QA Testing Notes

1. **Terms Acceptance Test:**
   - Navigate to checkout Step 3
   - Verify Complete Order button is disabled
   - Check one terms checkbox - button remains disabled  
   - Check both terms checkboxes - button becomes enabled
   - Uncheck either checkbox - button becomes disabled again

2. **Stripe Environment Test:**
   - Use test card 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Complete checkout flow but stop at final submission
   - Verify no actual charges created

### Rollback Instructions

1. **Terms Validation Issue:**
   ```bash
   git revert 66a8816
   ```

2. **Stripe Documentation Issue:**
   ```bash
