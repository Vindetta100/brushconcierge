# Git Recovery Guide

## Overview
This document contains instructions for reverting the repository back to its original state if the repository replacement process encounters issues.

## Current State Backup Process
Before replacing the repository content, we created a backup of the original state using the following steps:

1. Created a backup branch of the current state:
```bash
git checkout -b backup-original-state
```

2. Committed any pending changes to this branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Backup of original repository state"
```

## Recovery Instructions

### Method 1: Restore from Backup Branch
If you need to revert back to the original repository state:

1. Check available branches to confirm backup exists:
```bash
git branch
```

2. Switch to the backup branch:
```bash
git checkout backup-original-state
```

3. Make this the main branch (optional):
```bash
git branch -D main
git checkout -b main
```

### Method 2: If Backup Branch Is Missing
If the backup branch approach fails or the branch is not available:

1. Check for git reflog entries:
```bash
git reflog
```

2. Find the commit hash that represents the last known good state before replacement

3. Restore to that commit:
```bash
git checkout -b recovery-branch <COMMIT_HASH>
```

### Method 3: Manual Recovery
If all Git-based recovery methods fail:

1. If you have a separate backup of the files, restore those files
2. Re-initialize git if necessary:
```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Restored from manual backup"
```
