As QA Engineer-gpt, specializing in quality assurance, user experience, and e‑commerce flows, I reviewed my custom instructions and completed an end‑to‑end test of www.brushconcierge.com.

Test setup:

Accessed site on Vercel deployment.

Tested all three pricing tiers: $39 “Essentials,” $59 “Curator,” $99 “Atelier.”

Used Stripe test card 4242 4242 4242 4242 with fake details.

Stopped at “Complete Order” button to avoid live charges.

Functional observations
Each plan’s “Select Plan” button loads its own checkout URL (e.g., ?tier=atelier) showing plan name, price, and features

brushconcierge.com
.

Checkout flow has three steps: Information, Payment, Confirmation. Form validation works (errors shown if fields empty).

Test card details were accepted even though environment uses live keys. Thus Stripe’s test cards still work; no need to enable test API keys if using the universal test card.

Confirmation step displays entered info and final price, with terms checkboxes and “Complete Order” button

.

High‑level issues
Premature success message: Payment page shows “Welcome to Brush Concierge! Your subscription has been successfully created” before checkout completion

brushconcierge.com
.

Confuses users about subscription status.

Appears on all plan flows.

Mixed live/test environment: Site uses live keys yet accepts test cards.

Could cause accidental live charges if not careful.

Recommend separate staging environment or toggled test mode.

Accessibility concerns: Form labels lack clear focus indicators.

Could hinder keyboard‑only users.

Consider adding outlines or highlights.

Terms acceptance not enforced: Checkboxes for terms and renewal are optional; they aren’t required to proceed to final step

.

Might cause compliance issues.

Should require acceptance before enabling final button.

SEO/performance: The site loads large images on pricing page.

Slows down mobile users.

Compress images and use lazy loading.

Low‑level issues
UI message placement: “Subscription successfully created” sits under payment form

brushconcierge.com
.

Should only appear after order completion.

Spacing inconsistency: Padding varies between sections.

Causes uneven white space.

Standardize margins across components.

Minor typo: “Bi-weekly service available” appears on pricing card; hyphen usage inconsistent across plans.

Standardize copy across tiers.

Checkbox alignment: Terms checkboxes misaligned; text sits too high

.

Adjust vertical alignment for readability.

Button color contrast: Orange buttons on cream background may not meet accessibility contrast guidelines.

Increase contrast for better visibility.

Plan feature icons: Small ticks may be hard to see on mobile.

Increase size or weight for clarity.

No shipping cost shown: Order summary lists shipping as “FREE”; this may not reflect actual cost.

Confirm pricing or update label to “included.”

Stripe testing notes
Stripe’s universal test card (4242 4242 4242 4242) works in live mode for testing flows.

Because test keys in .env aren’t active, orders would charge real cards if used.

For safety, create a staging environment with test keys or enable Stripe’s test mode for QA.

Success criteria: All three checkout flows load properly; forms submit; test card accepted; final order summary matches plan price ($39, $59, $99)

. Only outstanding blocking issue is premature success message and terms acceptance; otherwise, flows appear ready for marketing launch.
