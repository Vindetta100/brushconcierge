# Website Legal Risk Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Risk:** High.
- **Primary Issues:** Unsubstantiated claims, specific health promises, missing legal policies.
- **Recommendation:** Immediate revision of high-risk language and creation of essential legal documents.

## High-Risk Claims (`concierge/index.html`)
### Health & Medical Claims
- **Claim:** "The Hidden Culprit Behind Your Breakouts"
- **Claim:** "hello to clear skin"
- **Claim:** "healthy, radiant skin"
- **Risk:** Directly links service to medical outcomes. Requires scientific substantiation. High litigation risk.
- **Recommendation:** Rephrase to focus on hygiene, not medical outcomes. 
    - **Replace:** "The Hidden Culprit Behind Your Breakouts" -> **With:** "Supporting your clear skin journey."
    - **Replace:** "hello to clear skin" -> **With:** "Hello to a fresh routine."
    - **Replace:** "healthy, radiant skin" -> **With:** "For visibly radiant skin."

### Guarantees & Absolutes
- **Claim:** "ensure flawless application"
- **Claim:** "100% Satisfaction Guarantee"
- **Claim:** "30-day money back"
- **Risk:** Absolute promises. Terms must be explicitly defined in a policy.
- **Recommendation:** Soften absolute language and link to detailed policies.
    - **Replace:** "ensure flawless application" -> **With:** "Helps promote a smoother application."
    - **Keep:** "100% Satisfaction Guarantee" & "30-day money back", but **Action Required:** Create and link to dedicated policy pages defining the terms.

### Factual Verifiability
- **Claim:** "FDA-Registered Facility"
- **Risk:** Extreme. Must be verifiably true. Severe penalties if false.
- **Recommendation:** **Cannot be rephrased if untrue.** This is a factual claim with legal standing. Misrepresenting it carries severe penalties.
    - **If True:** Keep the claim. Ensure documentation is current.
    - **If False (Alternative):** Replace with a quality-focused, non-regulatory statement. **Example:** "Adhering to strict quality protocols."

- **Claim:** "Dermatologist-approved processes"
- **Risk:** Requires documented approval from a qualified dermatologist.
- **Recommendation:** Claiming professional endorsement without proof is high-risk.
    - **If True (with approval):** Rephrase to be specific: "Our process was reviewed by dermatologist Dr. [Name]."
    - **If False (Alternative):** Focus on process benefits, not an endorsement. **Example:** "Our process is designed with care."

- **Claim:** "2,847 Reviews" & "50,000+ Brushes Cleaned"
- **Risk:** Must be accurate and verifiable data.
- **Recommendation:** Keep if accurate. Use dynamic numbers or qualify them (e.g., "Over 50,000 brushes cleaned").

- **Claim:** "Studies show...more bacteria than a toilet seat"
- **Risk:** High. Requires citation of a specific, relevant study.
- **Recommendation:** **DELETE**. **Replace with:** "Makeup brushes can be a breeding ground for bacteria."
- **Risk:** Requires citation of a specific, credible study.

### Testimonials
- **Claim:** Quotes from "Professional," "Influencer," "Celebrity" artists.
- **Risk:** FTC regulations require disclosure if testimonials are compensated. Must be from real clients.

## Medium-Risk Claims (`concierge/index.html`)
### Superlatives & Vague Terms
- **Claim:** "proprietary 7-step sanitization process"
- **Claim:** "Eco-friendly...processes"
- **Risk:** "Proprietary" and "Eco-friendly" have legal definitions and can be challenged.

### Service Level Agreements
- **Claim:** "5-7 business days door-to-door"
- **Risk:** Creates a contractual obligation. Must be consistently met.

### Scarcity Claims
- **Claim:** "Only 47 Spots Remaining This Month"
- **Risk:** Potential "dark pattern" if not verifiably true.

## Critical Missing Components
### Legal Documents
- **Missing:** Privacy Policy
- **Missing:** Terms of Service
- **Missing:** Refund/Guarantee Policy
- **Missing:** Shipping Policy
- **Risk:** Essential for operation. Lack of these policies creates significant liability.

## Action Plan

- **Action:** Rephrase all high-risk claims.
- **Example:** Change "ensures clear skin" to "helps support clearer skin by removing pore-clogging buildup."

### Phase 2: Legal Scaffolding
- **Action:** Create drafts for all missing legal policies.
- **Content:** Define terms for guarantees, refunds, privacy, and service.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Action:** I will perform these updates.
